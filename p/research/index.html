    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since the middle of the last century, with the continuous innovation of technology, biological research methods have continued to make progress, such as fluorescence imaging, luminescence imaging, photoacoustic imaging, optical tomography, and a series of blot hybridization methods. A series of advanced technologies combined with computers provide great convenience for modern scientists' data analysis. Due to the continuous improvement of experimental conditions, in order to provide more accurate experimental results, the experimenters have increased the number of samples in the experiment. At the same time, more samples have brought more cumbersome and complex data results analysis. Due to time and cost constraints, biologists will abandon manual statistical methods, and some will go out to seek software companies to obtain better data processing methods. However, there are always some communication gaps between biological researchers and software engineers, so this project attempts to develop a software for processing experimental information from the perspective of biological researchers.</p>
<p>Because there are complex and diverse branch areas in the biological field itself, this project attempts to study long-term potentiation (LTP) in neurobiology [1] The research direction of the complex biology of experiments such as synaptic plasticity The image is identified and analyzed.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity [2] is the most important characteristic in the animal nervous system. Animals have been cognizant of the outside world from birth, and through the shaping and reshaping of various nerve cells and tissues, such as changes in the proportion of gray matter in the center or changes in the number of synapses, the animal‚Äôs nervous system tends to Completeness and development are an important feature of animal growth and development at the individual level.</p>
<p>The long-term gain effect [3] is one of several phenomena of synaptic plasticity. Under a certain stimulus (such as chemical stimulation), the activity of the synapse is significantly increased, leading to an increase in the signal transmission details between neurons. The long-term gain effect is mainly used to study human memory, thinking, and nervous system development, and is closely related to diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and stroke. In an article reported in 2001, several scientists improved the original method and used the fluorescent dye FM 1-43 (FM1-43 is a bipolar fluorescent dye with hydrophilic groups and lipophilic groups. The clusters are located at the two ends of the molecule. In recent years, it has been used for in vivo labeling of endocytosis and exocytosis membrane-coated particles. In the field of neuroscience, this method can also be used as an important part of labeling functional presynaptic terminals. Tools. [4]), by using tetraethylammonium (TEA) [5] is a common anesthetic drug that blocks potassium ion channels,) or electrical stimulation of a specific frequency (200hz), which can affect the nerves in the hippocampus of the brain The element is stimulated to reflect the strength of the long-term gain effect by measuring the half-life of the brightness change of the vesicle bright spot.</p>
<p>Due to the experimental method of Stanislav S. Zakharenko1, Leonard Zablow1 and others [6], the number of vesicles under the two-photon microscope field of view is slightly larger (70-100 per field of view), and the vesicles have mobile behavior. The experiment with this method only needs to set up 3 groups, and each group needs to take a picture with an interval of 10s, and it needs to take at least 400s, so at least 8400 pictures are generated. The Internet has not searched for relevant analysis and statistics software, and has no contact with the original experimental method creators, and the current image processing software cannot meet the analysis needs of the experiment, and manual analysis requires a lot of manpower and time.</p>
<p>The focus of this project is to identify the number of vesicles in the picture, as well as the corresponding changes in position and brightness. The difficulty lies in solving the problem of analyzing the movement of vesicles.</p>
<p>This project is implemented by three people, one of whom has relevant experience in biological laboratories and has a strong interest in biology, and plans to engage in biological-related research in the future. The other two may not be in the Department of Biology, but they have a certain understanding of computer vision. , In the Student Union of Shuli College, I have instructed website construction and program design, understand Java, python and other languages, and can collaborate to complete some projects, which ensures that this project has a certain degree of feasibility.</p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>This project mainly uses JAVA language, and may use other languages at the same time. It will initially develop a runnable JAR program or other program, which can basically identify the location, number and brightness changes of the vesicles. Later, under the feedback of the experimenters, after revision Develop a program based on the Android system, and put the program into the Google App Store for sharing if conditions permit.</p>
<p>The specific research content is the program development work, and the final assessment results are two, which can basically identify the image and make a simple analysis program.</p>
<p>The key problem to be solved is to identify the number, position and brightness changes of vesicles located between neurons after fluorescence staining under a large number of two-photon microscopes, and collect the data, and conduct preliminary analysis through the program based on experience.</p>
<p>Since the proposal of the project is based on actual needs, the project leader has development experience and knowledge accumulation, so it is feasible.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>after investigating the preliminary requirements, the programming ideas were initially determined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the construction of the framework was realized, which can basically identify and analyze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preliminary application planning is carried out to determine the basic functions, required interfaces, and whether database support is required, and build a basic framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complete the interface design, including interface, list, menu buttons, etc., to achieve data operation and storage, and to modify and optimize based on the feedback of the experimenters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>background development and memory optimization, including implementation of garbage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collection, adapter optimization and screen adaptation, etc. Carry out the actual test of multiple models of the Android terminal, formulate the user agreement, and release the public beta version on the platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when conditions permit, after receiving feedback, the program will be optimized and updated, and the version update and maintenance plan will be finalized, and the official version will be released.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="innovation">Innovation</h2>
<p>This project was originally derived from the lack of fast and efficient analysis methods for the large number of images generated in the experimental methods of Stanislav S. Zakharenko1, Leonard Zablow1, etc. Since there are no relevant software analysis tools on the Internet, manual identification will consume a lot of time, energy. As a college student, I currently have the time and energy to make a program to fill the problem of image recognition and data processing in this experimental method. After the software is successfully developed, it can be shared via the Internet, allowing more scholars who use this experimental method to analyze and process experimental results faster and more conveniently.</p>
